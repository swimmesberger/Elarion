# EdgeTelemetry — the Elarion EF-free NativeAOT tier, on TimescaleDB

A telemetry ingest node published as a **native binary**: devices POST readings, operators query
latest values, recent history, and hourly aggregates from a **TimescaleDB hypertable**. The use case
is **cold-start speed and footprint** — edge boxes, scale-to-zero deployments, sidecars, CLI-style
lifetimes — and the business logic lives in **`[Handler]` classes like every Elarion app**: dropping
EF for this tier does not mean dropping the programming model.

```
POST /readings … GET /devices/{id}/stats     hand-authored minimal-API endpoints (RDG-compiled),
        │                                    one line each: bind → handler → Result<T> to HTTP
        ▼
[Handler] classes ([AppModule] Telemetry)    registered by the GENERATED module bootstrapper
        │                                    (AddElarion) — one always-on observability decorator only;
        │                                    gate decorators would attach per attribute
        ▼
Elarion.Sql                    (ADR-0058)    the access half: [SqlRecord] → generated
        │                                    ISqlRowMapper<T> + injection-safe interpolation
        ▼
TimescaleDB (ADR-0056: the extension rides the server image;
             enabling it is an ordinary migration — CREATE EXTENSION,
             create_hypertable, add_retention_policy, one transaction)
        ▲
Elarion.Migrations.PostgreSql  (ADR-0057)    the schema half: embedded V__ scripts, applied
                                             before the host reports ready, fail-closed
```

No EF, no reflection, no runtime code generation. Handler registrations come from the generated
bootstrapper, row mappers and JSON contracts are source-generated, and the endpoints are hand-authored
in the host compilation so **ASP.NET Core's Request Delegate Generator** compiles the binding ahead of
time too — that placement is deliberate (the ADR-0031 REST pattern): a Roslyn source generator cannot
see another generator's output, so endpoints emitted by a generator would silently fall back to the
runtime delegate factory. `JsonSerializerIsReflectionEnabledByDefault=false` holds for the whole
process. If a row type doesn't map, the **build** fails (`ELSQL001`–`ELSQL007`) — there is no
reflection fallback to limp along on, which is the property that makes NativeAOT safe here at all.

And because `Elarion.Sql` is hand-written SQL, the extension needs **zero framework support**:
`time_bucket`, `create_hypertable`, and the retention policy are just SQL — exactly the ADR-0056
claim that a specialized workload is a *recipe over the one PostgreSQL*, never a subsystem.

## Measured (Apple M4 Pro, .NET 10, TimescaleDB pg17 in a local container, 2026-07)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Publish output | **21 MB** self-contained native executable, **zero** trim/AOT warnings (17 MB without the OpenTelemetry pipeline) |
| Cold start, fresh database | **≈630 ms** to the first `200 /healthz` — dominated by the one-time `CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb` + `create_hypertable`; the runner, lock, and history bookkeeping are noise |
| Warm restarts (schema current) | **≈115–160 ms** to first response, migration validation and handler registration included — the handler pipeline costs nothing measurable |

## Run it

Single click — the Aspire launcher provisions TimescaleDB (a container runtime must be running;
Docker or Podman) and starts the API with the connection string injected:

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/EdgeTelemetry/EdgeTelemetry.AppHost
# API on http://localhost:5217, Aspire dashboard URL printed to the console
```

Or by hand, which is also the NativeAOT path (Aspire runs projects JIT via `dotnet run`):

```bash
# the recipe image (ADR-0056): TimescaleDB ships in the server image everywhere
podman run -d --name edge-ts -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg17
podman exec edge-ts psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE edge_telemetry"

# JIT for the inner loop…
dotnet run --project samples/EdgeTelemetry/EdgeTelemetry.Api

# …NativeAOT for the real thing
dotnet publish samples/EdgeTelemetry/EdgeTelemetry.Api -c Release -o out
./out/EdgeTelemetry.Api
```

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:5217/readings -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[
  {"deviceId":"edge-1","metric":"temperature","value":21.5,"recordedAt":"2026-07-14T10:00:00Z"},
  {"deviceId":"edge-1","metric":"temperature","value":23.0,"recordedAt":"2026-07-14T10:30:00Z",
   "meta":{"unit":"°C","source":"sensor-a","quality":3}}]'
# → {"written":2}   — POST the same batch again: {"written":0}, idempotent by constraint

curl "localhost:5217/devices/edge-1/latest?metric=temperature"
curl "localhost:5217/devices/edge-1/history?metric=temperature&limit=50"
curl "localhost:5217/devices/edge-1/stats?metric=temperature&hours=24"    # time_bucket rollup
```

## What to look at

- **`Migrations/V20260714090000__create_readings.sql`** — the whole TimescaleDB story is one
  transactional migration in the same history as everything else: `CREATE EXTENSION`, the table with
  its **composite natural key** (TimescaleDB's rule: every unique constraint must contain the
  partition column — and the same key makes ingest idempotent), `create_hypertable`, and an
  in-database `add_retention_policy` (zero application code; use an Elarion scheduled job instead
  when the window must live in app configuration).
- **`Modules/Telemetry/Handlers`** — the business logic, in the same `[Handler]` shape as every
  Elarion app, on the self-mapping Elarion.Sql surface: `db.QueryAsync<ReadingRow>($"{ReadingRow.Select} …")`
  resolves the mapper from the row type (no mapper argument, no `:raw`), and `IngestReadings` is one
  `db.InsertManyAsync(rows, " ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING")` — the helper owns the transaction and the
  reused prepared command (retransmitted device batches insert nothing). `GetMetricStats` is the
  "full power of SQL" leg — `time_bucket` + aggregates stay SQL, `{ReadingRow.Table}` splices the
  source table. Failures are `Result` values (`AppError.NotFound`, `AppError.Validation`),
  not exceptions. With no decorator attributes only the always-on `ObservabilityDecorator` wraps the
  handlers (ADR-0059: merged tracing + user-context enrichment — the `Elarion.Handlers` span +
  `handler.execution.duration` metric per call, near-zero cost when nothing listens); add `[Idempotent]`
  or `[RequirePermission]` later and only then does a gate decorator join the chain.
- **`Modules/Telemetry/TelemetryContracts.cs`** — the whole data contract. `ReadingRow` is a
  `[SqlRecord]`: the generated `ReadingRowSqlMapper` carries ordinal-cached typed reads, typed
  `BindParameters`, and the `TableName`/`Columns` constants the handlers compose SQL from.
  `MetricBucket` shows that a `[SqlRecord]` needs no physical table — it binds the `time_bucket`
  projection. The `[SqlJson]` meta column rides the module's `JsonSerializerContext`, which the
  bootstrapper contributes to the canonical options (ADR-0023) — one JSON config for HTTP bodies,
  ProblemDetails, and the jsonb column.
- **`Program.cs`** — the slim builder plus `AddElarion(configuration)` (the generated bootstrapper:
  module-gated handler registrations + JSON contexts), `AddElarionHttpJson()` (canonical JSON onto
  minimal-API binding, ProblemDetails included), `AddElarionSqlMappers()`, and
  `AddElarionPostgreSqlMigrations(dataSource, …)` for schema-before-traffic. Each endpoint is one
  line: bind → typed handler call → `ElarionHttpResults.ToResult` (200 / 400 / 404 ProblemDetails).
- **`EdgeTelemetry.Tests`** — the whole slice end-to-end against real TimescaleDB (Testcontainers,
  Docker-gated skip): startup migrates (extension + hypertable included), ingest flows through the
  handler pipeline into the generated mapper, a retransmit writes zero rows, and the rollup reads
  back through the projection mapper.
- **`EdgeTelemetry.AppHost`** — the one-click dev loop: Aspire provisions the TimescaleDB container
  (the same Postgres resource with a different image — the ADR-0056 posture in one line) and injects
  the connection string plus the OTLP endpoint. **Observability is composition too**: when
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is present, the API exports Elarion handler spans/metrics
  (`Elarion.Handlers` — `rpc.server.call.duration` per handler), Npgsql command spans/metrics,
  ASP.NET Core server telemetry, and structured logs — a dashboard trace reads
  HTTP → `telemetry.ingest` → the INSERT. Without an endpoint the whole pipeline stays unregistered,
  so the bare edge binary keeps its lean startup.

## Why this shape

The other samples show Elarion's default tier: [Billing](../Billing) is the layered EF host,
[LiveQuotes](../LiveQuotes) the realtime in-memory middle ground. EdgeTelemetry is the third
position: when the deployment target punishes cold start and footprint, drop EF — not correctness.
The [SQL mapping](https://elarion.wimmesberger.dev/docs/capabilities/sql-mapping) and
[SQL migrations](https://elarion.wimmesberger.dev/docs/capabilities/sql-migrations) docs carry the
full tier decision table; the short version is the first row of each: **if you can use EF Core, use
EF Core.** This tier exists for the hosts that can't. The
[time series](https://elarion.wimmesberger.dev/docs/capabilities/time-series) recipe shows the same
TimescaleDB composition on the EF tier;
[PostgreSQL extensions](https://elarion.wimmesberger.dev/docs/capabilities/postgres-extensions)
carries the image guidance.

The mapper itself is benchmarked at **hand-written ADO.NET parity in time and allocations**
(`tests/Elarion.Benchmarks`, `--filter "*SqlMapping*"`), so choosing this tier costs no runtime
performance over the code you would have written by hand — it just stops you writing it.
